The balloon is able to hold 60 million cubic feet or 1.7 million cubic meters of gas. With hydrogen’s net lift being 71.05 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet, our balloons will be able to hold roughly 4,263,000 pounds of weight. This will be more than enough to lift the passengers, luggage, and space pod.

Normally this would be used for different plastic packaging like plastic bags or plastic films. Due to the thin plastic film and the huge size of the balloon, it was able to resist the radical temperatures in the stratosphere.

<p>Flight Duration: 24 hours overnight package</p>
<p>Max Altitude: 100,000 ft.</p>
<p>Pricing: $200,000 per person</p>
<p>Due to the overnight stay the price will have to be appropriately adjusted compared to the other flights. Not only can you bring 15 people of your choosing but another pilot will have to take over in order to safely get the space pod to its destination. Along with increasing size of the space pod as well as breakfast, lunch and dinner being provided the price of $200,000 per person is the best you are going to get.This package also provides breakfast, lunch and dinner</p>

<p>Flight duration: 12 hour </p>
<p>Max Altitude: 100,000 ft. </p>
<p>Pricing: $150,000 </p>
<p>The biggest reason for this price is the extended amount of time on the space pod. We are going to have to supply more and ask for more from the Astrotrek team in order to keep this experience as fun and exciting for all the passengers. </p>

<p>Max Altitude: 100,000 ft.</p>
<p>Pricing: $130,000 per person</p>
<p>Much like the Fornax this is the cheapest price you're going to get for this amount of people and this duration of time. In order to cover the expenses of everything that goes into the Astrotrek experience this price only seems appropriate.</p>

<p>Flight duration: 2 hour</p>
<p>Max Altitude: 100,000 ft.</p>
<p>Pricing: $100,000 per person</p>
<p>Due to the low number of people going and the short flight duration when compared to the other flights, the $100,000 per person price is the cheapest option. In order to pay for the pilot, making the pod, all the perks that come with the pod, making and fueling the balloon, landing zones, insurance, pilot etc. this price would be the cheapest possible option if you are looking to explore space.</p>
